This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

> 프로젝트 초기 생성 목적
1. nginx를 테스트 하기 위해 작성한 기본 페이지
2. NBP(Naver Cloud Platform)에서 페이지를 띄워보기 위해 작성한 프로젝트
3. Linux를 이용한 github 테스트를 위한 프로젝트

> 프로젝트 향후 업데이트
1. 현재 즐기고 있는 게임인 LOL의 전략적 팀전투 모드의 조합들을 보기 편하게 정리해서 볼 수 있도록 구상중
   ( 간결하게 만든다는 것이지 lolchess.gg와 같이 전문성을 갖기는 힘듦. )
2. oven에서 현재 화면 기획을 하는 중.
3. lol api에서 필요한 api 정리 중.
3. 두 개가 정리 되면 React.js를 이용해서 페이지 구현 예정.

> 무엇을 활용할 것인가?
1. node.js
2. React.js
3. express
4. axios
5. https://developer.riotgames.com/
